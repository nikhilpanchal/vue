# vue
This appears to be a framework that captures the space *in between* AngularJS and ReactJS. It is more React-like than Angular in that it is also Virtual DOM and component based, but it also offers constructs like watchers, which are AngularJS constructs. With Vue though, your templates don't need to be in JSX, instead they could be in straight-up html. 

They claim to be **faster** than react in terms of Rendering speed, and also claim to have support from people from the React team like Dan Abramov supporting this claim, but this will require vetting out before it is to be believed. 

From what I've seen thus far, the learning curve for VueJS is even smaller than that for React, and one can bash up applications fairly quickly using Vue, so as of now, I think it is definitely worth a closer look.
